0.3.3 (14 May 2017)
-------------------

### bugfixes

-   Bulk exports stop immediately, when invalid XML is provided.
    ([issue #6](https://github.com/OpenEstate/OpenEstate-IS24-REST/issues/6))

### updates

-   Allow object descriptions with maximal 3999 characters.
    ([issue #4](https://github.com/OpenEstate/OpenEstate-IS24-REST/issues/4))
-   Support XKO country code for Kosovo.
    ([issue #5](https://github.com/OpenEstate/OpenEstate-IS24-REST/issues/5))
-   Add option to remove objects before update in bulk exports.
-   `org.openestate.is24.restapi.AbstractClient` implements `java.io.Closeable`.
-   Generated JAXB classes implement `java.io.Serializable`.
-   Replaced deprecated `org.apache.commons.io.IOExceptionWithCause` with
    `java.io.IOException`.
-   Support simple JSON requests within
    `org.openestate.is24.restapi.AbstractClient` via `sendJsonRequest()`.
    ([issue #7](https://github.com/OpenEstate/OpenEstate-IS24-REST/pull/7))
-   Updated `commons-io` library to version 2.5.
-   Updated `commons-lang` library to version 3.5.
-   Updated `jaxb2-basics` library to version 0.11.1.
-   Updated `Lorem` library to version 2.1.
-   Updated `slf4j` libraries to version 1.7.25.


0.3.2 (11 Mar 2016)
-------------------

### bugfixes

-   Less strict validation of e-mail addresses.
    E-mail addresses are currently validated with classes provided by
    [commons-validator](https://commons.apache.org/validator/) when XML is read
    or written. This validator does not handle new top level domains (nTLD)
    properly. Therefore the validation is replaced by a more simple approach,
    that validates the e-mail address against the pattern, that is specified by
    IS24 in `common-1.0.xsd`.

### updates

-   The package `org.openestate.is24.restapi.utils.validator`, that contains
    some classes of [commons-validator](https://commons.apache.org/validator/),
    was removed from source code.


0.3.1 (10 Mar 2016)
-------------------

### updates

-   Updated `slf4j` library to version 1.7.18.
-   Updated `jaxb2-basics` libraries to version 0.11.0
    and regenerated JAXB classes.


0.3 (12 Dec 2015)
-----------------

### new features

-   The library is available through [Maven Central Repository](http://search.maven.org/#search|ga|1|org.openestate.is24)
    from this release on. See [documentation page about Maven](https://github.com/OpenEstate/OpenEstate-IS24-REST/wiki/Integration-with-Maven)
    for more informations.
-   Low level methods to access [Geo Information Service API](http://api.immobilienscout24.de/our-apis/gis.html)
    were implemented (see [`GIS.java`](https://github.com/OpenEstate/OpenEstate-IS24-REST/blob/v0.3/OpenEstate-IS24-REST/src/main/java/org/openestate/is24/restapi/GIS.java)).

### bugfixes

-   Updates and publishings are separately executed during bulk exports.
-   Always parse / print `xsd:decimal`, `xsd:double` or `xsd:float` values as
    `java.lang.BigDecimal`.

### updates

-   The JAXB classes were regenerated against the latest XSD schemas from IS24.
-   [`Authorization`](https://github.com/OpenEstate/OpenEstate-IS24-REST/blob/v0.3/OpenEstate-IS24-REST/src/main/java/org/openestate/is24/restapi/utils/Authorization.java) and
    [`Verification`](https://github.com/OpenEstate/OpenEstate-IS24-REST/blob/v0.3/OpenEstate-IS24-REST/src/main/java/org/openestate/is24/restapi/utils/Verification.java)
    classes are implementing [`java.io.Serializable`](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/io/Serializable.html).
-   The following schemas are not provided anymore by IS24. Their corresponding
    Java classes / packages were removed from this library:
    -   `alterationdate-1.0.xsd`
    -   `bookingoverview-1.0.xsd`
    -   `productrecommondation-1.0.xsd`
    -   `realestatestock-1.0.xsd`
    -   `zipandlocationtoregion-1.0.xsd`
-   Classes and methods, that were marked as deprecated in 0.2.x versions
    have been removed.
-   Updated `annotations` library from FindBugs to version 3.0.1u2.
-   Updated `commons-lang` library to version 3.4.
-   Updated `jaxb2-basics` libraries to version 0.10.0.
-   Updated `lorem` library to version 2.0.
-   Updated `slf4j` library to version 1.7.13.
-   Updated HTTP components libraries in the `hc43` module to version 4.3.6.


0.2.3 (09 Apr 2015)
-------------------

### bugfixes

-   Automatic removal / deactivation of untouched objects during a bulk export
    may fail under certain conditions. Instead of processing untouched objects
    only all currently published objects are removed / deactivated at the
    webservice.

### updates

-   Updated slf4j to version 1.7.12.


0.2.2 (19 Mar 2015)
-------------------

### new features

-   Store the value of `L-IS24-RequestRefnum` header for failing requests into
    the `RequestFailedException` (for low level exports) and `ExportMessage`
    (for bulk exports). In case of problems with a certain request, one can
    provide the corresponding number to IS24 together with a support request.
    This allows IS24 to track the error / problem much easier and to provide
    better support for their users.

### bugfixes

-   If a transferred property provides more attachments than allowed by the
    webservice, an incorrect ordering of attachments may occur. We should make
    sure, that attachments are always send to the webservice in the correct
    order. This guarantees, that the title image is always properly transferred
    and only attachments from the end of the list are rejected / ignored.

### updates

-   Made some API improvements & documentations.
-   Updated dependencies jaxb2-basics-runtime 0.9.3, slf4j 1.7.10 & junit 4.12.
-   Changed signature of some protected logging functions in
    `org.openestate.is24.restapi.utils.ExportHandler`.

### deprecations

-   Changed signature of the constructor in
    `org.openestate.is24.restapi.utils.Response`.


0.2.1 (26 Jan 2015)
-------------------

### bugfixes

-   During the transfer of a property the maximum number of allowed attachments
    can exceed temporarily. We should make sure, that old attachments are
    removed from the Webservice **before** any new attachments are uploaded to
    the Webservice.


0.2 (27 Dec 2014)
-----------------

### new features

-   implemented a high level API for the export process (see
    [`BulkUploadExample.java`](https://github.com/OpenEstate/OpenEstate-IS24-REST/blob/v0.2/OpenEstate-IS24-REST-examples/src/main/java/org/openestate/is24/restapi/examples/BulkUploadExample.java),

-   implemented a basic web application
    [`OpenEstate-IS24-REST-webapp`](https://github.com/OpenEstate/OpenEstate-IS24-REST/blob/v0.2/OpenEstate-IS24-REST-webapp)
    to illustrate the
